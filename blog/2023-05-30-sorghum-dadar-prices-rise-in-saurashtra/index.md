- 8000 bags arrived in the mandi today, the Saurashtra delivery, spot billty price, is stable at Rs. 3,800~4,200/q
- Maharashtra's Dadar sorghum has increased by Rs. 200/q, with Saurashtra delivery trading at Rs. 4,400~4,500/q
- Production of Dadar sorghum is less and the demand is high, due to which the market is likely to rise beyond Rs. 500/q
