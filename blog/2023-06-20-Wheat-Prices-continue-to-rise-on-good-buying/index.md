- These days an improvement of Rs.25/q is being seen in the prices. The main reason for this is the delay in the rain and fewer arrivals.
- The arrival has reduced in most of the mandis and the demand is good. 
- Due to this, the prices are increasing daily in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and other states.
- There is good demand from South India. 
- Along with this there is good demand from flour mills as well.
