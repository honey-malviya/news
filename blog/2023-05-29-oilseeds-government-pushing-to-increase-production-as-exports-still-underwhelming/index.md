- To reduce the gap between production and consumption, the government is encouraging farmers to increase production of oilseed.
- These efforts have also yielded some results, and the production of oilseed has improved over the years. India is estimated to import 143.7 LMT of vegetable oil in 2022~23, as against 140.7 LMT in 2021~22.
- This is marginally better than the 153.2 LMT imported in 2016-17.
- Soybean and mustard are the major crops, accounting for 35% and 32%, respectively.
